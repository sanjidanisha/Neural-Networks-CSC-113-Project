What are Weightless Neural Networks?
Neural Networks are a subset of learning algorithms within the machine learning field that are loosely based on the concept of biological neural networks. The name Neural Networks is almost exclusive to the UK and alternatively can be called n-tuple networks or RAM based networks. We will work with Weightless Neural Networks (WNNs) are based on networks of Random Access Memory (RAM) nodes, these have a very different model of a neuron, a memory. These neurons have no weights, hence ‘weightless’ nets and learning is also different and much simpler. Since these Weightless Neural Networks are based on memory they are implemented in Hardware, WISARD was the first commercial neural network system. Weightless networks arose out of Bledsoe and Browning’s work (1959) on n-tuples n-tuples are n bits (binary digits) sampled from input data. The n-tuple neuron is basically a standard RAM, as mentined before. A n-tuple is put on the input address lines of the RAM. To learn, a value is written into the specified address. To analyse, read from the addressed location.
